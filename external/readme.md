# External Services Simulation

This directory simulates external microservices that our application might interact with.

## Focus: User Management

For this example, we'll focus on simulating a **User Management** microservice. This service will handle operations related to user accounts, including but not limited to:

*   **User Creation:**
    *   Provisioning new user accounts.
*   **Permission Management:**
    *   Modifying user permissions and access levels.
*   **User Deletion:**
    *   Removing user accounts from the system.
*   **Token Management:**
    *   Updating user token counts (e.g., for API usage limits or virtual currency).
*   **JWT Authentication:**
    *   Generating and validating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication.

## Purpose

This simulation allows us to develop and test our application's interaction with external services that don't actually exist.
